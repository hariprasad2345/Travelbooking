        <p><b>A beacon of hospitality:</b> When Rosewood Hong Kong opened in 2019, its 65-storey tower became an unmistakable <br>
            feature of the city’s skyline. It’s the Rosewood Hotel Group’s seventh location to open in Asia, delivering its<br>
             signature luxe hospitality experience set to the stunning backdrop of Victoria Harbour and now named The Best<br>
              Hotel in Asia 2023.</p>
        <p><b>Artful touch:</b> The elegant interior of the hotel is the masterful work of Taiwanese-born designer Tony Chi,<br>
              whose penchant for modern style and understated opulence is manifest throughout. Contemporary pieces accent its<br>
              lobby and numerous hallways, including works by Damien Hirst and Henry Moore. Octagonal designs are also woven <br>
               into the core of its design philosophy, drawn from the auspicious significance of the number eight in Chinese<br>
                tradition.</p>
            <p><b>Where am I sleeping?</b> All 413 rooms in the hotel are a tale of two halves. The bedroom areas are all about neutral<br>
                 tones, plush seating and polished wood, offering a restrained aesthetic designed to encourage a state of total zen,<br>
                  rounded off by the floor-to-ceiling windows offering unparalleled vistas of Hong Kong Island. Enter the bathrooms,<br> 
                  however, to be greeted by symphony of marble and mirrors, eliciting the palatial feel of a bygone era. Perhaps a <br>
                  mismatch on paper, both work in total symbiosis to deliver a timeless and multi-faceted taste of luxury across each <br>
                  guest’s stay.</p>
