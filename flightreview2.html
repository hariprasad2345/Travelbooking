        <p><b>Singapore air has lots of room for improvement</b></p>
           <p>I almost wanted to give 1 star but I held back as service recovery was done by a attentive staff <br>
            that was not in charge of my seat section. No children headphone offered to my child. And cabin crew <br>
            conveniently missed out our drinks during dinner service. Understanding that…</p>

        <p><b> Beware as they change date of flight without notification</b><br>
            This is the worst airline ever. They change date of flights without informing the passenger. They wont even accept their mistake. You will waste your money and time in this airlines. Wont ever book with this airlines again.</p>
