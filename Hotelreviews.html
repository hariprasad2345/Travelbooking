        <h1>Rosewood Hong Kong</h1>
        <p>Hong Kong</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <p><b>A beacon of hospitality:</b> When Rosewood Hong Kong opened in 2019, its 65-storey tower became an unmistakable <br>
            feature of the city’s skyline. It’s the Rosewood Hotel Group’s seventh location to open in Asia, delivering its<br>
             signature luxe hospitality experience set to the stunning backdrop of Victoria Harbour and now named The Best<br>
              Hotel in Asia 2023.</p>
        <p><b>Artful touch:</b> The elegant interior of the hotel is the masterful work of Taiwanese-born designer Tony Chi,<br>
              whose penchant for modern style and understated opulence is manifest throughout. Contemporary pieces accent its<br>
              lobby and numerous hallways, including works by Damien Hirst and Henry Moore. Octagonal designs are also woven <br>
               into the core of its design philosophy, drawn from the auspicious significance of the number eight in Chinese<br>
                tradition.</p>
            <p><b>Where am I sleeping?</b> All 413 rooms in the hotel are a tale of two halves. The bedroom areas are all about neutral<br>
                 tones, plush seating and polished wood, offering a restrained aesthetic designed to encourage a state of total zen,<br>
                  rounded off by the floor-to-ceiling windows offering unparalleled vistas of Hong Kong Island. Enter the bathrooms,<br> 
                  however, to be greeted by symphony of marble and mirrors, eliciting the palatial feel of a bygone era. Perhaps a <br>
                  mismatch on paper, both work in total symbiosis to deliver a timeless and multi-faceted taste of luxury across each <br>
                  guest’s stay.</p>

        <p>This hotel is one of the best we have ever been to. The love for the details is enormous and that's what it is all about.<br>
            Regarding functionality there is still room to improve. It's obvious that the look and the design - besides the service quality - count the most for the owner family.<br>
            It is a very expensive pleasure to stay at that hotel but the guests are fully rewarded for their willingness to spend a lot of money.<br>
            The generosity of the hotel is extravagant and the employees pamper the guests in many ways.
            It would go too far to list all the different experiences we had but everything (with very few exceptions) was outstanding.</p>
