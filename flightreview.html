        <p>Worst airline,
            Travelling with a child. No seat belt for the child was told “please hold your toddler. <br>
            No warning that they don’t serve food in flight. You have to pay for really bad noodles and spinach sandwich you would not feed a death row inmate.<br>
            Time is something they are not good at keeping, almost missed connecting flight from Singapore.<br>
            No one offers to help even when it’s clear they have made a mistake.<br>
            A bus service is better than this.<br>
            I believe my children have developed travel trauma from these people.</p>
